# EJPT-Course-Study-Plan

This is a study plan for the official materials and content from INE for the Penetration Testing Student (PTS) course materials.

## How It Works

The materials are divided into courses. Each course contain videos and labs. Some video have labs along with them, and others do not.  

I gave each video that has no lab 2x its time to watch and the video and write notes about it. If the video has a lab you should spend 3x its time for watching it, applying the lab, and writing your notes.

You can either watch the complete first and then apply the lab, or apply the lab while you watch the video (follow instructions and apply then step-by-step). Personally, I found the second one is better for me as it took less time compared to the first one.

## Daily Goal

The goal is to spend around 2-3 hours each day studying the course materials. Note that this study plan does not consider time for revision or practicing what you have learned through CTFs. You can manage this on your own on the pace that suits you.

### Note

A note here, you do not have to do all CTFs before the exam. Personally, I did not do any CTF before the exam - except the black-box machines that were provided during the course, and I managed to pass the exam.

However, I recommend you doing some machines before the exam as this will make the exam more easy for you to pass. Inshallah I will write about my exam experience soon and I will leave a reference for it here!
